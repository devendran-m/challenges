# Challenges and Solutions
My coding challenges and my solution attempts

This repository is a consolidation of all my coding challenges and the solutions that I attempted.

It covers the coding challenges that  I attempted across coding challenge sites like Codewars, Frotnend Mentor etc.

I have segregated them into HTML, CSS, and Javascript folders where the respective challenges and solutions are recorded

My aim is to build a respository that will cover all the challenges that I attempted, the solutions that I came up with and what are the helps and references that I used in solving some of the challenges.

I hope overtime when the repository is built overtime, it can server as a reference for their learning.
